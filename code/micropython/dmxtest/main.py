'''
Simple test script to test dmx capability of LightBrain board
https://github.com/BrightestBrains/LightBrain

I didn't get the result I wanted because it doesn't work right.
But thanks to this script, it became clear that the hardware part works.
Functionality: press buttons to move through 'values buffer'
The user LED will be set to the current value and the value will be sent to the DMX
